- API
API is a specification that describes how information is exchanged between two or more applications. APIs provide extra security while sharing information. Think of API as the channel we will use to exchange information between the web application (dashboard), mobile application and any third party application. And all the information will be stored in one central database (your company database).
- Database
The system will use a single relational database and a backup database for all the applications. The database will be backed up automatically to the backup database to avoid data loss. Our team will beef up the server and database security to protect the system from any malicious attacks

- Security
We prioritize application security and we focus more on application security to make sure that the users who use the system transact on a secure and protected system. We use token based requests and oauth authentication. 
We validate every transaction and http request in each step in the system.
Note that the functions, activities and features described in this SRS might change during application development as required by Your Company or when advised by our company.

The following payment methods will be used in the system.
